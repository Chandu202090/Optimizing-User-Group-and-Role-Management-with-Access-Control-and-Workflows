5. 🏫 Institution/Company Ready: Perfect for schools, banks, hospitals, companies.


6. 🖥️ Role-Specific Dashboards: Personalized views and actions based on role.



✅ Example Scenarios:

A university admin portal where:

Students view results.

Teachers upload marks.

Admins manage accounts.


A hospital system where:

Doctors access patient history.

Nurses view assigned duties.

Admins manage users and records.
